# REGEX-PRACTICE
Project Title: Kaggle Dataset Analysis with Regex

Description:

This project is a collection of data extraction and analysis tasks performed on a Kaggle dataset using Python and regular expressions (regex). The dataset, named "KaggelMostVotes.csv," contains information about various datasets available on Kaggle. The project utilizes the Pandas library to read and manipulate the dataset.

Key Tasks:

Finding Kaggle URLs: Identify and extract URLs (Links) within the dataset that contain "kaggle.com."

Extracting File Extensions: Use regex to extract file extensions (FileType) from the URLs (Links).

Soccer Dataset Identification: Find datasets with Titles containing the word "Soccer," regardless of case.

Machine Learning Uploader: Extract the dataset Uploader names that contain "Machine Learning," performing a case-insensitive search.

Fraud Detection Datasets: Identify datasets with descriptions (Sub-title) containing the word "fraud," regardless of case.

Extracting File Sizes: Extract file sizes (FileSize) specified in megabytes (MB) from the dataset.

Gigabyte-Sized Datasets: Find datasets with file sizes specified in gigabytes (GB).

Numeric Titles: Identify datasets with Titles containing numeric characters.

View Counts with "k": Extract dataset Views values with "k" (representing thousands) at the end.

Finance-Related Tags: Find datasets with Tags containing the word "finance," performing a case-insensitive search.

Secure URLs: Identify and extract dataset Links (Links) that are secure URLs starting with "https."

Version Numbers: Extract version numbers (Version) with a single digit after the decimal point.

This project showcases the power of regular expressions and data analysis with Pandas for various data extraction tasks. It provides valuable insights into working with textual data and demonstrates how regex can be a powerful tool in data manipulation and analysis.
